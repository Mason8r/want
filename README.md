Webpack doing crazy things to 
Angular2 which is interacting with a 
NodeJS (+ Express4) api backend, (nearly) all written in
Typescript, the sexiest dialect in JavaScript. 
=====

###todo
Awful lot left to do here:
* Get the test config running
* Get some basic up passing
* Get backend transpiling in TS
* Get a handful of endpoints running
* Interact with endpoints with NG2
