The WANT stack
=====
__Webpack__ doing crazy things to 
__Angular2__ which is interacting with a 
__NodeJS__ (+ Express4) api backend, (nearly) all written in
__Typescript__, the nicest dialect in JavaScript. 
###Awful lot left to do here:
* Get the test config running
* Get some basic up passing
* Get backend transpiling in TS
* Get a handful of endpoints running
* Interact with endpoints with NG2
